# iPARQ Automation Chrome Extension

Currently, this project serves to validate permit PSID's, prices, & names are correctly recorded in the "iPARQ Permit Creation Template" but through a Chrome Extension.

# Built with Chrome Extension Boilerplate with React 17 and Webpack 5

I did not build the boilerplate code, please visit their repository for more information on the source code.
